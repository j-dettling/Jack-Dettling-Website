        Jack Dettling is a keyboard player, composer, and curator who resides in Los Angeles. Their interests include lesser-played Baroque repertoire, experimental works of the 20th-century, player pianos, analog synthesizers, historical and contemporary tuning systems, the intersection of ancient and modern literatures. They approach the piano with an acknowledgment of the complexity of its history, with a desire to extend the common practice forward and backward. They perform in living rooms, in galleries, in concert halls. They are the founder and artistic director of beauty salon, a space for intermedia installation and performance in Los Angeles. They hold degrees in piano performance and literature from Mannes College/The New School, contemporary piano performance from Manhattan School of Music, and piano performance and composition from CalArts, where they teach currently.Â
